This is a SCSS library to convert your starter web projects into beautifull mockup site.
Responsive, Light and Dark themes and fully combinable styles to play with!

## All semantics covered
You can try different styles for Heros Sections, Logos & Brands, Cards, Footers and so on.
- $nav[0-4]
- $hero[0-4]
- $brand
- $card
- $footer

## Combine different styles
Try any of the following web-styles to match what you're looking for, or just for fun and get inspired
- $rounded[0-3]
- $glossy[0-3]

> It will generate different encoded assets, for example, in mobile devices, the navs component will be wrapped as a dropdown menu with the tipic menu icon automaticlly.

Scrolling to Cards Section with **$glossy** class on body tag (try the $fancy style for this section, it's cool and has animations).

You can combine multiple styles applying the mentioned classes on different sections/divs/articles etc.
Also, there are few components customizables like $buttons[0-5] and $badges[0-5]

### Work In Progress
This is a side-personal project, I'll try to give love to it from time to time.
Enjoy it!
